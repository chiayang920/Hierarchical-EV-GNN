**Concept and Architecture of EV-GNN**
  - **EV Charging Problems**: Visualized as a network of charging stations connected to the grid. The problem is formulated as a mathematical optimization with objectives such as minimizing load peaks or maximizing profits, subject to constraints like power limits and EV State of Charge (SoC) requirements.
  - **Graph Modeling**: EV charging optimization is represented as a graph with nodes for EVs, chargers, transformers, and Charging Point Operators (CPOs), each with unique features.
  - **Graph Simplification**: Nodes with no active connections, such as certain idle charging stations, are removed from the graph.
  - **Node Feature Processing**: Node-specific Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) convert heterogeneous features into uniform, higher-dimensional embeddings.
  - **Actor Network**: Uses $L$ GCN layers to process the graph, reducing node features to a fixed size suitable for continuous or discrete action spaces. Outputs are mapped to a standard action vector.
  - **Critic Network**: Combines action features with state features, processes them through $K$ GCN layers, and aggregates into a fixed-size graph-wide embedding. This embedding is used in an MLP to compute the Q-value.
